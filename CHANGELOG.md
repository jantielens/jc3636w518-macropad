  - Image API endpoints are also protected when enabled

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` and `docs/web-portal.md` with Basic Auth behavior and API examples

## [0.0.27] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Device-side firmware online update from GitHub Releases (Firmware page → “Online Update (GitHub)”, stable releases only)
  - Board-specific app-only asset selection: `<PROJECT_NAME>-<board>-vX.Y.Z.bin`
  - New APIs: `GET /api/firmware/latest`, `POST /api/firmware/update`, `GET /api/firmware/update/status`

- Build embeds board name as `BUILD_BOARD_NAME` and auto-detects GitHub repo from `git remote origin` to enable online updates

### Fixed
- Improve GitHub API JSON parsing reliability for `/api/firmware/latest`

---

## [0.0.26] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- GitHub Pages web firmware installer powered by ESP Web Tools (generated by `tools/build-esp-web-tools-site.sh`)
- Pages deployment workflow that runs on stable release publish (`.github/workflows/pages-from-release.yml`)

### Changed
- Release workflow now publishes merged firmware binaries (`*-merged.bin`) suitable for browser flashing at offset `0`
- Pages deployment now runs from the default branch context (avoids tag-based deploy restrictions on the `github-pages` environment)

## [0.0.25] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- Compile-time flags reporting tool (`tools/compile_flags_report.py`) that generates `docs/compile-time-flags.md` (flag list, board matrices, and per-file preprocessor usage map)
- Build-time “active flags” summary printed during `./build.sh` per board

### Changed
- CI board build matrix ordering is now deterministic (sorted board names)
- Compile-time flags documentation generation is enforced in CI (fails when generated doc differs)

## [0.0.24] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- Screen saver / burn-in prevention (v1): inactivity-based backlight fade-out and wake fade-in
- Display control API endpoints: `GET /api/display/sleep`, `POST /api/display/sleep`, `POST /api/display/wake`, `POST /api/display/activity`, `PUT /api/display/brightness`

### Changed
- Touch input now resets the screen saver idle timer during normal UI interaction
- Screen saver behavior suppresses touch input while dimming/asleep/fading in to avoid wake gestures clicking through into LVGL navigation

### Fixed
- Avoid potential boot hangs by deferring LVGL touch input device registration and retrying later

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/web-portal.md`, and `docs/display-touch-architecture.md` for screen saver config and APIs

## [0.0.23] - 2025-12-23

### Changed
- WiFi station mode disables power-save sleep to improve stability/latency

### Fixed
- WiFi connection now prefers the strongest AP when multiple BSSIDs share the same SSID (Fixes #25)

## [0.0.19] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed
- Fixed board macro sanitization in build system to generate valid C++ identifiers
  - Board names with special characters (hyphens, dots, etc.) now properly converted to underscores
  - Macro pattern: `BOARD_<BOARDNAME>` where `<BOARDNAME>` is alphanumeric + underscore only

  - Resolves compilation errors when using `#if defined(BOARD_xxx)` with hyphenated board names
- Updated documentation to explain board macro sanitization behavior

---

## [0.0.18] - 2025-12-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Reversed FQBN_TARGETS associative array mapping in `config.sh` (Resolves #21)

  - Board name is now the key, FQBN is the value
  - Enables multiple board variants with the same FQBN (e.g., CYD display v2/v3)
  - Simplifies helper functions (`get_fqbn_for_board()` is now direct array lookup)
  - **Migration**: Swap keys and values in your `FQBN_TARGETS` array
- Updated build scripts, CI/CD workflows, and documentation to use new mapping format

### Fixed
- **Board Override System**: Fixed include guard conflicts and circular dependencies (Issue #14)
  - Renamed board-specific files from `board_config.h` → `board_overrides.h` to prevent naming conflicts
  - Implemented two-phase include pattern: board overrides loaded first, then defaults with `#ifndef` guards
  - Removed `#include_next` directive that caused infinite recursion errors
  - Removed non-functional `board_config.cpp` files (Arduino build system only compiles sketch directory)
  - Board overrides now working correctly for compile-time configuration

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Complete rewrite of board configuration documentation
  - Added real-world examples: buttons, battery monitors, different display drivers
  - Clarified that board overrides are for compile-time defines only
  - Documented conditional compilation pattern with `#if HAS_xxx` in application code
  - Updated README.md, copilot-instructions.md, and build-and-release-process.md
- **Board Override Pattern**: System now uses conditional compilation in main app instead of separate implementation files
  - Cleaner architecture with zero runtime overhead
  - All board-specific logic uses `#if` guards in `app.ino`
  - Compiler automatically eliminates unused code per board

### Removed
- `src/boards/<board>/board_config.cpp` - Not compiled by Arduino build system, was misleading

---

---

## [0.0.11] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- Single-board workflows (e.g., `um.sh`) now accept an explicit board argument without treating it as a serial port (prevents uploads to a non-existent port named after the board)
- Captive portal startup now marks AP mode active so watchdog/DNS handling correctly recognizes captive portal state

## [0.0.10] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Board-Specific Configuration System**: Flexible optional override system for multi-board support
  - Default configuration in `src/app/board_config.h` used by all boards

---

## [0.0.6] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **WiFi Stability Improvements**: Comprehensive WiFi connection reliability enhancements
  - WiFi hardware reset sequence on each connection attempt (OFF → STA mode cycle with delays)
  - Disabled persistent WiFi storage (`WiFi.persistent(false)`) to prevent NVS corruption
  - Automatic reconnection enabled at WiFi stack level (`WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true)`)
  - WiFi event handlers for connection lifecycle (connect, got IP, disconnect with reason codes)
  - WiFi watchdog in main loop (10-second interval) for automatic recovery from connection loss
  - Detailed connection diagnostics logging (SSID not found, wrong password, connection lost, etc.)
  - Automatic mDNS restart after reconnection

### Fixed
- **WiFi Connection Failures After OTA/Reboot**: Hardware reset sequence prevents WiFi radio state corruption that survives software reboots
- **No Recovery from WiFi Drops**: Watchdog + auto-reconnect + event handlers provide triple-layer protection for runtime connection stability
- **Limited WiFi Diagnostics**: Status reason logging helps identify connection failure causes

### Changed
