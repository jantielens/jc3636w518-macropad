## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.0.12] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `build.sh` now injects board override include paths/macros and supports optional build profiles without requiring `get_build_props_for_board`.
- `src/app/board_config.h` automatically pulls board-specific overrides when `BOARD_HAS_OVERRIDE` is defined, with no app code changes.

---

## [0.0.11] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- Single-board workflows (e.g., `um.sh`) now accept an explicit board argument without treating it as a serial port (prevents uploads to a non-existent port named after the board)
- Captive portal startup now marks AP mode active so watchdog/DNS handling correctly recognizes captive portal state

## [0.0.10] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Board-Specific Configuration System**: Flexible optional override system for multi-board support
  - Default configuration in `src/app/board_config.h` used by all boards
  - Optional board-specific overrides in `src/boards/[board-name]/board_config.h`
  - Board-specific implementations in `src/boards/[board-name]/board_config.cpp`
  - Build system automatically detects and includes board overrides when present
  - Example: ESP32-C3 Super Mini with LED on GPIO8 (vs GPIO2 default)
  - Supports board-specific functions via feature flags (e.g., `HAS_CUSTOM_IDENTIFIER`)
  - Zero runtime overhead - all configuration resolved at compile time

### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Moved board overrides to `src/boards/` for better organization
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs to reflect board configuration system

---

## [0.0.9] - 2025-11-27

### Removed
- **Streaming Logs Feature**: Removed unstable web portal log streaming
  - Removed LogBuffer, `/api/logs` endpoint, and web log viewer
  - Simplified LogManager to serial-only output
  - Preserved all formatting features (nesting, indentation, timing)

### Changed
- **WiFi Connection**: Faster and more reliable connection handling
  - Reduced retry attempts: 5→3, optimized timeout: 5s→3s per attempt
  - Added hard reset retry before AP fallback (WiFi power cycle)
  - Total connection time: ~37.5s (was 75s)
  - Updated logMessage/logMessagef to single-line format

### Fixed
- Duplicate mDNS startup causing "Service already exists" error
- WiFi watchdog disrupting AP mode fallback
- ESP32-C6 FQBN configuration
- AP mode now stays active when WiFi connection fails

---

## [0.0.8] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
- **CPU Usage Calculation**: Fixed CPU usage metric to show real-time usage instead of cumulative average
  - Changed from cumulative runtime to delta-based calculation between measurements
  - Added 100ms minimum interval to prevent measurement jitter
  - Now accurately reflects current CPU load, especially noticeable under stress testing
  - First measurement returns 0%, subsequent calls show accurate real-time usage percentage

---

## [0.0.7] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Gzip Compression for Web Assets**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are now automatically gzip compressed
  - Reduces flash storage usage by ~80% (64KB → 12KB for web assets)
  - Reduces bandwidth usage for web portal access
  - Automatic compression during build via `tools/minify-web-assets.sh`
  - Assets served with `Content-Encoding: gzip` header
  - Browser automatically decompresses (transparent to users)
  - Build output shows compression statistics (Original → Minified → Gzipped)

### Changed
- Modified `tools/minify-web-assets.sh` to add gzip compression step after minification
- Updated `web_portal.cpp` handlers to serve gzipped content with proper headers
- Web assets now stored as `uint8_t` byte arrays instead of string literals

---

## [0.0.6] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **WiFi Stability Improvements**: Comprehensive WiFi connection reliability enhancements
  - WiFi hardware reset sequence on each connection attempt (OFF → STA mode cycle with delays)
  - Disabled persistent WiFi storage (`WiFi.persistent(false)`) to prevent NVS corruption
  - Automatic reconnection enabled at WiFi stack level (`WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true)`)
  - WiFi event handlers for connection lifecycle (connect, got IP, disconnect with reason codes)
  - WiFi watchdog in main loop (10-second interval) for automatic recovery from connection loss
  - Detailed connection diagnostics logging (SSID not found, wrong password, connection lost, etc.)
  - Automatic mDNS restart after reconnection

### Fixed
- **WiFi Connection Failures After OTA/Reboot**: Hardware reset sequence prevents WiFi radio state corruption that survives software reboots
- **No Recovery from WiFi Drops**: Watchdog + auto-reconnect + event handlers provide triple-layer protection for runtime connection stability
- **Limited WiFi Diagnostics**: Status reason logging helps identify connection failure causes

### Changed
- WiFi initialization now includes proper reset sequence: disconnect → OFF → delay → STA → delay
- Event-driven WiFi state management with callbacks instead of polling-only approach

---

## [0.0.5] - 2025-11-26

### Added

  - Template substitution in HTML files at build time (e.g., `{{PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME}}`)
  - Auto-generated C++ defines in `web_assets.h` for firmware use
  - Branded AP SSID, device names, web portal titles, and release artifacts

  - Release files: `{PROJECT_NAME}-{board}-v{version}.bin`
- Updated README.md with comprehensive release process documentation
- Streamlined release artifacts to include only firmware binaries and checksums

### Fixed
