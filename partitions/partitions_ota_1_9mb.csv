# Custom partition table for OTA support (installed via tools/install-custom-partitions.sh)
#
# Goal:
# - Maximize app partition size while keeping dual OTA partitions (app0/app1)
# - Keep only minimal SPIFFS (rarely used in this template)
#
# Notes:
# - Offsets (except nvs/otadata) must be aligned to 0x10000 (64KB)
# - The FQBN option `PartitionScheme=ota_1_9mb` must match this filename (without .csv)
#
# Name,    Type, SubType,  Offset,   Size,     Flags
# NOTE: Macro config is stored as a single NVS blob (~22KB). The default 0x5000
# NVS partition is too small once device config is also stored. Increase NVS and
# shift app partitions accordingly (still fits in 4MB flash).
